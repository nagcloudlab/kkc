// Service Factors

// 1. Throughput: The producer can send messages at a high rate, depending on
// the configuration.
// 2. Latency: The time taken to send a message can vary based on the
// configuration and the network conditions.
// 3. Durability: The producer can ensure that messages are not lost by using
// acknowledgments and retries.
// 4. Availability: The producer can continue to send messages even if some
// brokers are down, as long as there are enough in-sync replicas available.

// How to Achieve High Throughput and Low Latency
// 1. Use batching: By configuring the batch size and linger time, the producer
// can send multiple messages in a single request, reducing the number of
// requests sent to the broker.
// 2. Use compression: By compressing the messages, the producer can reduce the
// size of the messages sent over the network, reducing the network traffic and
// improving throughput.
// 3. Use idempotence: By enabling idempotence, the producer can ensure that
// messages are not duplicated,
// which can help in achieving higher throughput and lower latency.
// 4. Use appropriate partitioning: By using a custom partitioner, the producer
// can control how messages are distributed across partitions, which can help in
// achieving better load balancing and higher throughput.
// 5. Use appropriate acknowledgments: By configuring the acknowledgments, the
// producer can control how many replicas need to acknowledge the message before
// considering it sent, which can help in achieving better durability and
// availability.
// 6. Use appropriate retry configuration: By configuring the retries and retry
// backoff, the producer can handle transient errors and ensure that messages
// are sent successfully, which can help in achieving better durability and
// availability.
// 7. Use appropriate request timeout: By configuring the request timeout, the
// producer can control how long it waits for a response from the broker before
// retrying, which can help in achieving better availability.

// How to Achieve High Availability
// 1. Use multiple brokers: By configuring the producer to connect to multiple
// brokers, it can continue to send messages even if some brokers are down.
// 2. Use appropriate acknowledgments:
// By configuring the acknowledgments to wait for all in-sync replicas to
// acknowledge the message,
// the producer can ensure that messages are not lost even if some brokers are
// down.
// 3. Use appropriate retry configuration: By configuring the retries and retry
// backoff, the producer can handle transient errors and ensure that messages
// are sent successfully, which can help in achieving better availability
// 4. Use appropriate request timeout: By configuring the request timeout, the
// producer can control how long it waits for a response from the broker before
// retrying, which can help in achieving better availability.

// How to Handle Failures
// 1. Use retries: By configuring the retries and retry backoff, the producer
// can handle transient errors and ensure that messages are sent successfully.
// 2. Use appropriate acknowledgments: By configuring the acknowledgments to
// wait for all in-sync replicas to acknowledge the message, the producer can
// ensure
// that messages are not lost even if some brokers are down.
// 3. Use appropriate request timeout: By configuring the request timeout, the
// producer can control
